Got tired of alt-tabbing to price check every item, so I built LAMA (Live Auction Market Assessor) — a lightweight overlay that reads item data from your clipboard and pulls live market prices. No copy-paste into a browser, no extra tabs, no hassle.

It's completely free, open-source, and being built by CouloirGG — a small indie studio making free tools and games for the community.

Still polishing things up before release, but wanted to share a preview. More details soon at [couloir.gg](https://couloir.gg).

Happy to answer any questions.

## Post 2 — PoE2 Forums

**Title:** LAMA — Free Open-Source Price Check Overlay (Coming Soon)

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

I've been working on a tool called **LAMA** (Live Auction Market Assessor) that I wanted to share with the community before launch.

**What it does:**
LAMA is a lightweight overlay that sits on top of PoE2 and reads item details from your clipboard (Ctrl+C). It then cross-references live market data to give you an instant price estimate — no alt-tabbing, no copy-pasting into a browser, no interrupting your flow.

**Why I built it:**
Console players especially get a rough deal with price checking, and even on PC the alt-tab workflow breaks immersion and slows you down. I wanted something that just *works* in the background.

**The details:**
- Completely free — no premium tiers, no ads, no catch
- Open-source under GPLv3
- Built by [CouloirGG](https://couloir.gg), a small indie studio focused on free tools and games

Still finishing things up, but launch is coming soon. I'll post again when it's live. In the meantime, happy to answer questions or hear what features you'd want to see.

## Notes
- Reddit post is deliberately short — let the GIF sell it
- Forum post goes deeper since that audience wants to understand the tech and philosophy
- Consider posting Reddit during peak hours (weekday evenings EST tend to do well for gaming subs)
